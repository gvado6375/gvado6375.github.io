Another HTML element that can display text in another font size would be the
header element. 
Example: writing <h1>WildRescues Website Outline</h1> would increase the text size 
to a large header. 
An HTML element that can create a numbered outline would be the ordered list element. 
Example: 
<ol>
<li>Home Page: </li>
<li>About Us Page: </li>
<li>Partnership Page: </li>
<li>Gallery Page: </li>
<li>FAQs Page: </li>
<li>Contact Us Page: </li>
</ol>
Now the list will be numbered automatically.
